## NOTE: THIS IS DESIGNED FOR SDK 2013 SINGLEPLAYER, COMPATIBILITY WITH MULTIPLAYER IS NOT GUARANTEED

This is a port of Half-Life 2's default menu to the Client DLL, so you can do whatever you want with it.

Usually its locked behind GameUI.dll, meaning you can't do anything with it outside of the customization that the schema gives you.
